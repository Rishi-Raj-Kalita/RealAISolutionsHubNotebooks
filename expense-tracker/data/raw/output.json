Looking at the context provided, there are four entries with different amounts and dates.\n\nFirst, I see an entry from 02/03/25 with a type of input_amount. The narration mentions "Did I spend any amount in food," which directly relates to their question. The amount is 5161.0, so that"s the figure they"re looking for.\n\nI should confirm if this is indeed related to March and ensure there are no other entries from March with similar details. Checking the dates: one on 02/03/25, another on 01/03/25, and one on 13/03/25. The 02/03/25 entry is the only one that matches both the type and the question.\n\nSo, I can confidently say they spent ₹5161 in food during March based on this entry.\n</think>\n\nYes, you spent ₹5161 in food in March."}
