It looks like there's been a bit of a copy-paste error here. I'll summarize the LinkedIn post for you:

**Title:** Incorporating Memory into AI Agents: A Simplified Guide

The author has created a simplified blog post that explains three essential types of memory in AI agents:

1. **Sematic (Factual)**: storing facts like "Paris is the capital of France."
2. **Episodic (Experiential)**: storing experiences like "Last time this client emailed about deadline extensions..."
3. **Procedural (Instructional)**: storing instructions like "Always prioritize emails about API documentation."

The blog post uses clear analogies and step-by-step code implementation to teach these concepts, along with a GitHub link for easy experimentation.

Now, let's evaluate the post based on your criteria:

* Is it related to AI? Yes
* Does it introduce new concepts or ideas in AI? Yes (explaining three essential types of memory)
* Is it informative and educational? Yes

Based on these factors, I would rank this post as a good example of an informative and educational post about AI. However, since there are multiple copies of the same post, I'll assume you want me to evaluate only one instance.

Now, let's move on to selecting the top 3 posts based on your criteria:

Since all instances of the post are identical, I'll select this post as one of the top 3 posts. However, I don't have any other posts to compare it with, so I'll assume there are no other relevant posts.

**Top 3 Posts:**

1. **Incorporating Memory into AI Agents: A Simplified Guide**
	* This post introduces three essential types of memory in AI agents and provides a simplified explanation.
2. (No other relevant posts available)
